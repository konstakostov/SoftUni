                        Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do
                        that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.

                        Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the

                    Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual
                    accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain
                    uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company
                    work, a society work, a civilisation work.
